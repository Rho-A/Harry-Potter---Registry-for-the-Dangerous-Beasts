# Harry Potter: Registry for the Dangerous Beasts

## Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures - Beast Division

This application is a registry of dangerous beasts under the care of Wizards and Witches. 
The users of this application are employees of the Beast division at the Department for the Regulation and Control of 
Magical Creatures at the Ministry of Magic. I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series, in particular the beasts
depicted in the story, which inspired me to create a project with a Harry Potter theme.
